This is the iOS client code for the award-winning iOS app "Just Landed" that I developed circa 2012.

Just Landed was a #1 paid travel app for iOS that launched in June 2012 on the Apple App Store. Just Landed made it easy to pick someone up at the airport on time â€” just enter their flight number and we'd alert you when you need to leave for the airport. We took into consideration your location, current traffic conditions, and real-time flight data (from FlightAware) to remind you to leave at just the right time. Just Landed was featured by Apple in "New & Noteworthy", "What's Hot" and "Amazing on iPhone 5", and was been covered by Lifehacker, Mashable, CNET and PC Magazine among many others. The app was even featured on TV on both CBS and ABC News in the US! Sadly, after 4 successful years on the App Store, I decided to shut down Just Landed on July 31st 2016, because it had become unprofitable and difficult to maintain.

The iOS client is a pretty simple frontend for the Google App Engine server code (repo: just-landed) that was the brains of the product. The code has not been updated to run on recent versions of iOS (after 2016).

Given that it's been almost 10 years since this product was available for download, it seems reasonable to make the code public to anyone who might be interested. Use it at your own risk however you see fit.

I was the sole programmer on this project, and as such, the code is somewhat lacking in documentation, tests, and is generally somewhat sloppy. But hey, it worked!
